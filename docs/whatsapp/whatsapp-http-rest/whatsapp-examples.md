**Message template with quick reply button**

Suppose there exists a message template with the following data.

Template name: `deal_offer`

Template body: `Hi {{1}}.\n\nYour order of {{2}} has been prepared for shipping. We can send it to you in three different ways.\nOption 1: {{3}}\nOption 2: {{4}}\nOption 3: {{5}}\n\n Please select your preferred delivery option.`

Template quick reply buttons:

1.  Option 1
2.  Option 2
3.  Option 3

The template can be used to send a message like this:

```
{
  "to": [
    "46732019282"
  ],
  "message": {
    "type": "template",
    "template_name": "deal_offer",
    "language": "en",
    "body_params": [
      "John",
      "books",
      "By train",
      "By car",
      "By drone"
    ],
    "media" : {
      "type": "text"
    },
    "buttons" : [
      {
        "type": "quick_reply",
        "payload": "books train"
      },
      {
        "type": "quick_reply",
        "payload": "books car"
      },
      {
        "type": "quick_reply",
        "payload": "books drone"
      }
    ],
  }
}
```

The quick reply button payload, which is returned in a callback notification when the recipient presses that button, could be used to easily collect statistics about the most popular delivery choices for books, for instance.
